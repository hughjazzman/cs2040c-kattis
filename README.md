# Programming Problems

This repository contains my own implementation of the programming assignments and problems related to *data structures and algorithms*. To my knowledge, all the code should be fully functional and working. 

## CS2040C Assignments

* AY19/20 Semester 2
* Prof Alan, Cheng Ho Lun

This NUS module introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The module covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, basic analysis of algorithms, and basic object-oriented programming concepts. Assignments were given full credit.

## Kattis

* Practice for CS2040C
* [Some problems used under Prof Steven Halim](https://nus.kattis.com/courses/CS2040C)

Kattis filenames correspond directly to the problem links. All should be accepted (AC) code.

## Google Kick Start

My own attempts at some (usually easier low pointers) [Google Kick Start questions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart).
